##House price prediction :-
  This project uses linear regression algorithm to predict houses prices based on multible features such as area /number of bathrooms /year biuld and other propertys  
   it include complet stages from 
   
   1\EDA --> Exploratory Data Analysis

   2\Feature engneering 
   
   3\Encoding
   
   4\Scaling 
   
   5\model building
   
   6\model evaluation
   
the dataset used in the hose price advancesd regression techniquse , data set from kaggle 
##Project Workflow :- 
 1- data cleaning and handling the missing values 
 
 2-Exploratory Data Analysis 
 
 3-feature ingneering - creating new feature as total area ,total bathrooms ... 
 
 4-Encoding categorical variables 
 
 5-feature scaling 
 
 6-model training evaluation 
 
 7-visualization of actual vs predicted prices
